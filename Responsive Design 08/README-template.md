## Overview

### Notification Features

**Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications**: 

- This falls under notification management.

- To **distinguish** between  `unread` and `read` **notifications**: 

  -  `unread`  **notifications** `background color` will be `light grayish blue 1` with a `red dot`

  -  `read` **notifications** `background color` will be `light grayish blue 2`




**Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero**: 

- This is a notification management feature.

- To implement this feature, we have `3` **unread** notifications:

  1) Mark Webber reacted to your recent post My first tournament today!
      -  1m ago
  
  2) Angela Gray followed you
      - 5m ago

  3) Jacob Thompson has joined your group Chess Club
      - 1 day ago

- Once we click the  `Mark all as read` button, the user shall be able to see the notification number `3` decremented back down to `0`

- Turn the `unread` background of `light grayish blue 1` to `light grayish blue 2` to distinguish it as `read`
