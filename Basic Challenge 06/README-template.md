## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- SASS / SCSS

### What I learned

- `:checked` pseudo-class with **input checkboxes** 

- **General Sibling Combinator** `(~)` 


### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I am proud to only use `SCSS` to combine `:checked` pseudo-class with **input checkboxes** and **General Sibling Combinator** `(~)` to create a `pricing component with toggle`

### What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

A challenge I came across was using  **General Sibling Combinator**. 

It wasn't working as expected because **General Sibling Combinator** can only be used to select elements that share the same parent. 

Thus, I had to refactored my `HTML` layout to fit this mandatory requirement


### What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

At the moment, none.
