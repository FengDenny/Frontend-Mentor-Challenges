## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- SASS / SCSS


### What I learned

- Learned how to use `grid-template-areas` (desktop) / mobile grid layout and Flexbox for inner layout

- Learned mobile and desktop layout

- Learned accessibility

- Learned mobile first approach 

- Learned media queries to layout desktop


### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I did mobile-first approach using Grid with rows and transitioned to desktop using  `grid-template-areas` for desktop layout

If I were to do this project again, I would use Flexbox instead of Grid.
