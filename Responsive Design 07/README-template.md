## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- SASS / SCSS


### What I learned

- Learned how to use Grid for outer layout with one rows and two columns (desktop) / one row and column (mobile) and Flexbox for inner layout

- Learned mobile and desktop layout

- Learned accessibility

- Learned mobile first approach 

- Learned media queries to layout desktop


### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I did mobile-first approach using Grid with a single row / column and transitioned to desktop with a single row and two columns

If I were to do this project again, I would use Flexbox instead of Grid.
