- Learned how to Flexbox for mobile / desktop layout

- Learned accessibility

- Learned mobile first approach 

- Learned media queries to layout desktop


### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I did mobile-first approach using Flexbox and then transitioned into desktop with Flexbox

If I were to do this project again, I would use Grid instead of Flexbox.
