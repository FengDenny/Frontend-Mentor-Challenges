## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS

  - Flex Box

  - Media Queries 

  - Custom property syntax (local / global)

  - Transitions


### What I learned

- Learned how to use flex box and nested flex box

- Learned how to create fluid Image and typography

- Learned accessibility

- Learned CSS transitions 



## Extra Challenges

- Instead of using the given coloring schemes, I have decided to create my own using the following colors:
```css
  /* text, primaries, secondaries, accent */
  --bright-cyan-blue: hsl(188, 83%, 70%);
  --light-cyan-blue: hsla(188, 96%, 67%, 0.801);
  --light-blue: hsl(188, 96%, 67%, 20%);

  /* background */
  --dark-blue-purple: hsl(247, 68%, 51%); 
```

- Since, I used this project to learn more about ``css transitions``, I have decided to add an extra feature. 

* The extra feature added was a `hover` effect to show `social icons` using `Font Awesome icons`
